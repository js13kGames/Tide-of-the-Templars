## Commands

### `yarn install`

Installs dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Starts [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`. You should be able to access the server on your mobile device from your home network by going to your computer's IP address (e.g. `http://192.168.0.2:8080`).

### `yarn build`

Builds, minifies, and inlines the game to `./dist/index.html`. This command also runs [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer), and places the report in `./dist/report.html`. This report may be handy in figuring out which of your source files is putting you over the edge of 13k.

### `yarn party`
